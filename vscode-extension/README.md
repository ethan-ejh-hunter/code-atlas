# CodeAtlas Annotations Extension

This extension integrates VS Code with the CodeAtlas documentation server.

## Features

- **View Annotations**: See implementation notes, translations, and documentation directly in your code files as comments.
- **Edit/Add Annotations**: Add new notes by replying to comments or creating new ones.
- **Performance**: Optimized for large codebases.

## Requirements

- **CodeAtlas Server**: You must be running the CodeAtlas server (`python3 code_atlas/app.py`) locally on port 5000.
